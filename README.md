# Government Spending

This is a visualization of government spending between the years 1900 and 2020. See it in action [here](https://nwbvt.github.io/GovSpending/)

Spending data is taken from [https://www.usgovernmentspending.com](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com) and exported into data/*.csv. Preprocessing is done with the `genData.py` script. To run it run `./genData.py > data/data.json`.

Event data (which is presented as annotations on the side) are stored in `data/events.json`.
